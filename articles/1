<p>I am usualy a very rational person. I sometimes overthink stuff.
I also don't like taking risks.
I never played Diablo on Hardcore. So making a decision like this, without really knowing what is going to happen next was hard for me.
Best decisions are made from that gut feeling when something just feels right. This job started like that and now is ending the same way.
Those three years were great but I started to crave for more and my dreams became bigger. And so I realized I need to start taking risks.
That I am not going to fulfill my dreams by playing it safe, and I don't want to live a life where I am not doing everything I can to make
those dreams come true.</p>

Someone said that work can be either a job, a carrer or a calling. Job or career somehow does not seem to be enough for me.
I am a programmer, a solver, an engeneer. If I didn't think that it is a bit overused, I would even call myself a hacker.
Solving real problems of real people is what I want/have to do. As many others, it is not something I decided I would like to do it is just what I am.

I am always hungry and now it seems I started with the foolishness part.
